# Instructions

You will be shown a graph with three types of points: blue circles, blue crosses, and green circles. The graph will only be visible for 1 second per graph. You will have to identify in which quadrant the blue crosses appear most. You will be shown 7 graphs.

After seeing all of the graphs, you will be asked to identify which pair of quadrants (1 and 3 or 2 and 4) had blue crosses most often.

For reference, the quadrants are as follows:
 - Quadrant 1 - Positive X, Positive Y
 - Quadrant 2 - Positive X, Negative Y
 - Quadrant 3 - Negative X, Negative Y
 - Quadrant 4 - Negative X, Positive Y
